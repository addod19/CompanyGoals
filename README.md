## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. `git clone https://github.com/addod19/CompanyGoals.git`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rails db:create`
4. `rails db:migrate`
5. `rails s`

### Prerequisites

- Ruby v2.7.1
- Heroku
- Rails v6.0.4

## Test using Postman

- To Get a specific goal with all it's children `http://localhost:3000/goals/1`
- After clicking `send` we either expect a success or failure message, in our case `success` message as seen below: We expect a `json` response in the format. Here is what I have currently without the parent/company goals. But it will be fixed
